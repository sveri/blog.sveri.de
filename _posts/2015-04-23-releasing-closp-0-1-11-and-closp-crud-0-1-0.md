Today I release a new version of closp which includes closp-crud.
  
You can find the change list of closp at the bottom of the readme: [https://github.com/sveri/closp](https://github.com/sveri/closp "closp")

I also released closp-crud, which is a leiningen CRUD plugin generating SQL files, HTML templates and clojure database and routes code for the operations.
  
I provided some documentation on how to get running here: [https://github.com/sveri/closp-crud](https://github.com/sveri/closp-crud "closp-crud")

I also made a 12 minute introduction video on how to use that plugin and setting up closp before: <http://www.twitch.tv/sveri80/v/4298695>

Disclaimer: The audio is not the best and I have some hiccups with an already running figwheel process that must have crashed somewhere. So, live debugging is included ðŸ˜‰
