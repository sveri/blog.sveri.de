Hate it or love it.
  
If you use (g)vi(m) often or from
  
time to time and firefox for browsing you
  
definitely need vimperator:   
[vimperator](http://vimperator.org/ "vimperator")

This is such a great Add which makes browsing with
  
your keys an easy thing, just like editing files
  
with vim.

Thanks to the developers for that good
  
work.
