From Henk to Hendrix by Neil Young

From hank to hendrix
  
I walked these streets with you
  
Here I am with this old guitar
  
Doin what I do.

I always expected
  
That you should see me through
  
I never believed in much
  
But I believed in you.

Can we get it together
  
Can we still stand side by side
  
Can we make it last
  
Like a musical ride?

From marilyn to madonna
  
I always loved your smile
  
Now were headed for the big divorce
  
California-style.

I found myself singin
  
Like a long-lost friend
  
The same thing that makes you live
  
Can kill you in the end.

Can we get it together
  
Can we still stand side by side
  
Can we make it last
  
Like a musical ride?

Sometime its distorted
  
Not clear to you
  
Sometimes the beauty of love
  
Just comes ringin through.

New glass in the window
  
New leaf on the tree
  
New distance between us
  
You and me.

Can we get it together
  
Can we still walk side by side
  
Can we make it last
  
Like a musical ride?
