I recently moved my blog from serendipity to wordpress (see here for more: [moving from serendipity to wordpress](http://blog.sveri.de/2012/03/03/converting-from-serendipity-to-wordpress/ "Converting from serendipity to wordpress")). This changed all my links, what is kind of sad if you come here from a search engine, linking to the old url-style from serendipity.

Please use the search from wordpress in the top right to find your post. It&#8217;s still here, i promise, just under a different url.
