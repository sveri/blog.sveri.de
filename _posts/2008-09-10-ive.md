written a small phyton script, wrapped up in a much smaller
  
bash script which converts a django test class into
  
a digraph file.
  
The bash script then makes a svg out of it.

I did not test this script very much, ist just
  
a short afternoon hack to get a picture of
  
my workflow.
  
It works for me and thats all i want.

It extents test driven developement a bit
  
in the way that it picturizes your tests
  
and the given workflow.

An example test file is provided in the archive:  
[convertDjangoTesttoDigraph](http://sveri.net/sonstiges/convertDjangoTesttoDigraph.tar.bz2 "convertDjangoTesttoDigraph")

What you really need is a python interpreter and
  
the dot program which comes with graphviz.

I think this script will work under windows (cygwin)
  
and mac too.

Just try it out and adapt it to your needs.
