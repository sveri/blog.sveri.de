Today i wondered how hard it might be to debug a luminus webapp. Turns out, as its java, its as easy as always.

Just set the JAVA_OPTS (under windows):
  
set JAVA\_OPTS=-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt\_socket,server=y,suspend=n

And then start as usual with:
  
lein ring server

Afterwards you can connect in eclipse or intellij via the remote debug option. Thats it ðŸ™‚
