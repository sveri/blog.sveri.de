wouldn&#8217;t dream of it.

A Machine that creates Machines or products.
  
Ok, no one dreams of that really.

But what if that machine would be cheap and small
  
and fit into every home, just like printer?

It&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s reality, it&#8217;s called RepRap.
  
Ok, it&#8217;s not that far, you cannot build a car
  
from it or a pc, but it&#8217;s new and you can build
  
simple things with it.
  
So give it time, one day it will produce everything
  
you need, i am very certain of it.

And the best of all, it&#8217;s gpl&#8217;ed.
  
No money for licences to give to some big company
  
or something like that, it&#8217;s free, at least the idea
  
and the concept.

Now, enough of that, have a look yourself:
