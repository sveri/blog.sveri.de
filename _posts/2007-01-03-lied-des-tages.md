Weil ich heut so in Bloglaune bin:

Bob Dylan &#8211; All along the Watchtower

&#8222;There must be some way out of here,&#8220; said the joker to the thief,  
&#8222;There&#8217;s too much confusion, I can&#8217;t get no relief.
  
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
  
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth.&#8220;  
&#8222;No reason to get excited,&#8220; the thief, he kindly spoke,  
&#8222;There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
  
But you and I, we&#8217;ve been through that, and this is not our fate,
  
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late.&#8220;

All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
  
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.

Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
  
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.
