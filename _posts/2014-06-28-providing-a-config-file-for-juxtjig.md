Today I was trying out:Â  <https://github.com/juxt/jig>
  
The configuration of jig says: <https://github.com/juxt/jig#configuration> that you have to put a config.[edn|clj] file into the &#8222;config&#8220; folder. I was trying to create config folders with a configuration everywhere, but did not succeed. However, if you look into the source code of jig you will see that jig loads the configuration from io/resource, so I had to put it into the &#8222;resources&#8220; folder of jig and instantly it worked.

Easy, isn&#8217;t it?
